# CommunityTweets
Formerly known as meteor2twitter at GitLab. This code runs [AusGLAMBlogs](https://glamblogs.newcardigan.org)

v 0.5.0

## Overview

This is a Meteor app that allows users to add a blog feed listing via a web interface, stores them in a Mongo database, and tweets when a new feed is added or a new post is published.

It loops every 10 minutes, and only announces one new feed each cycle, to avoid triggering Twitterâ€™s spam blockers. Each post is tweeted three times. six hours apart.

Bloggers can register their blog, and then one or more administrators approve the new listing - everything in the RSS feed (usually the last 10 or 20 posts) is then added to the app's index, and new posts will be added and tweeted.

Your community can find the latest posts either by following your twitter bot or checking/searching the web app.
