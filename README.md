# CommunityTweets
Formerly known as meteor2twitter at GitLab.

v 0.5

## Overview

This is a Meteor app that allows users to add a blog feed listing via a web interface, stores them in a Mongo database, and tweets when a new feed is added or a new post is published.

It loops every 10 minutes, and only announces one new feed each cycle, to avoid triggering Twitterâ€™s spam blockers. Each post is tweeted three times. six hours apart.


### Set Up

You need to be running [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) including all **requirements** and **dependencies** (listed below).

On first use, go to **[url]/startup** to set admin user.

Prior to putting in production, ensure you change `pocketRedirectUrl` from `localhost:3000` to your own base URL in both server.js and client.js, as well as other necessary edits to wording of pages etc (code here comes with all the original `ausGLAMBlogs` wording, which should be changed for obvious reasons).

In addition to environment settings for `PORT`, `ROOT_URL`, `MONGO_URL` and `MAIL_URL` (see Mailgun documentation) you'll need to use `METEOR_SETTINGS` for:

* SITE_NAME ('My Awesome Website')
* EMAIL_FROM (email address you want your email messages to appear to come from)
* TWITTER credentials (see Twitter documentation)
* POCKET_KEY (Pocket platform consumer key)
